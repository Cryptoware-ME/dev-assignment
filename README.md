# dev-assignment

An assignment to create a DApp . This repository contains all the chainEnd source code needed.

You will have to create a react or nextjs app (choose between the two) according to the design included in the repository "Minting_page.pdf" and integrate it with the contract contained in the blockend folder.

The user must be able to connect his wallet with the "Connect Wallet" button and then mint an NFT using the "mint" button. You are also required to display the mintPrice fetched from the contract in ETH.

All other fields contained in the design are required, but their functionality is optional.

HINT: To be able to complete the task, you will need the abis folder and the contract address contained in the .env.local file of the blockend folder.

NOTE: Please create a branch under your name and push all the code there.
